[] I don't want users to finish the game, they should play indefinitely. So let's add more items to purchase. Get rid of the winGame function. There is no winning.
[] Let's move the Item Store to the top of the pane it's currently in. 
[] TIME PLAYED does not show up completely and gets cut off. 
[] PIZZA CLICKER v3.0 could be more prominent or replace pizza party clicker? 
[] Let's add some way to incorporate the picture of Bill Lumberg from office space. Maybe randomly he can pop in like that animation from the Mortal Kombat games who says Frosty or Toasty. Instead we can trigger some audio there. The picture is called office_space.png
